    "    - We can see that as perplexity decreases, accuracy tends to increase.\n",
    "- **Is there a relation to the insights from the previous problem?**\n",
    "    - It is clear that with smaller datasets, the discriminative models tend to outperform the generative models. However, as the dataset size increases, the generative models begin to outperform the discriminative ones. This observation correlates with the discussion in Question 11.\n",
    "- **Why does logistic regression with the interaction term perform so well for larger datasets?**\n",
    "    - For larger datasets, logistic regression can estimate the actual model's coefficients with a high degree of accuracy by capturing the complex interactions more effectively.\n",
    "- **Does your dummy classifier ever outperform other classifiers, or do different classifiers outperform the optimal Bayes classifier?**\n",
